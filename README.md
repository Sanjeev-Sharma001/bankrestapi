# bankrestapi

  I have created 2 routes one is to get list of all banks and other one is to get details
  I used flask framework and SQLite3 for quering the data from the database

  First I have converted the .txt file to .db file and after that I have connected the db to sqlite3 server


# Time taken
It took me around 3 days to complete this because I have learnt all the required skills like flask and sqlite3 and I applied it
